# Epiphany Repentogon Menu

![Alt](image.png?raw=true "pingas!")

I was working on this earlier this year but I got side-tracked with other shit and I have
no idea how to fix some of these bugs BUUUUUUT people were asking about it so I'm
dumping it here instead of letting it rot on my hard drive.

Maybe someone that has more knowledge about Repentogon implementation details
and/or workarounds can find a way to fix some of this stuff.

## Bugs/Issues
- Locked characters don't render properly.
- Tarnished characters are "morped into" from untainted characters instead of selected
at the start of a run, this causes things like multiple actives and incorrect HP values.
- Completion mark page flashes untainted marks before showing tainted marks when
switching to tarnished sheet.
- Background isn't updated when switching to tarnished sheet.
